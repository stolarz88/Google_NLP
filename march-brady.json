{"body":"Tom Brady only started taking less money later on in his career once he married Gisele. His early extensions were for big QB money. Also, Brady takes less money because he continues to extend his contract years before they expire. If you're extending your contract as an older QB, you usually take less money overall for more money upfront and more guaranteed money. That's been the Pats M.O. with players they consider essential. Gronk and Aaron Hernandez got extended by the Pats after their second seasons. The results speak for themselves: Gronk is still on a bargain of a deal while Hernandez's subsequent arrest and prison sentence meant that he was an albatross on the Patriots salary cap till his deal expired. \n\nLet's not forget that Brady was getting these extensions in his mid-to-late 30's. Even though he's played at a higher level for longer than any other QB ever, at the time he was being extended no one really knew how long he could go on for. They still don't know.  Deadspin did a breakdown of Brady's extensions and they argue that Brady hasn't been taking as much of a discount as people think.

{"body":"## 2017 Free Agents /u/kinghenrypym\n\n### Foreword \n\nPer Overthecap, prior to the start of free agency the New England Patriots will have around $59,667,426 in cap space this offseason. While this may seem like an embarrassment of riches for a reigning Super Bowl Champion, keep in mind that the Patriots have a butt load of free agents, several of which could command $10 million+/year contracts. I truly believe the Patriots\u2019 free agent class is the best by far in the league and many players will receive above market contract offers from other teams. As many know, [Belichick is not one to pay top dollar for players](https://pics.me.me/bye-tombradysego-when-someone-asks-bill-belichick-for-more-money-15764356.png) unless he believes that the player has truly bought into the Patriots system (see: Devin McCourty). More high-profile Patriots free agents from the magical 2016 season will likely be headed to other teams rather than returning. In addition, Belichick will most likely free up additional cap space by restructuring Danny Amendola\u2019s contract, releasing Sebastian Vollmer, and/or extending Tom Brady. With that in mind let\u2019s take a look at the Patriots\u2019 free agents in order of expected 2017 salary.\n\n### Unrestricted Free Agents\n\n*Dont\u2019a Hightower, LB* - To say Hightower is an important part of the team is an extreme understatement. There\u2019s not much that can be said about Hightower that has not been said already but his growth over the last half of a decade has been extremely consistent and he\u2019s matured into the leader of the defense. Although he\u2019s been plagued by nagging minor injuries (he\u2019s only played a full season once in his 5 years in the league) he\u2019s a major impact player when he\u2019s on the field as he\u2019s able to [rush the quarterback,](https://gfycat.com/RemarkableGreedyFoal) [stop the run,](https://gfycat.com/SpecificIcyAlpaca) and [cover.](https://gfycat.com/LeafyBewitchedFlycatcher) Any pats fan would love to have Hightower back especially considering Jamie Collins and Chandler Jones were shipped off rather abruptly, but Hightower\u2019s price tag may be too much. I could envision a scenario much like McCourty\u2019s two years ago where the Patriots reward Hightower with a market value contract around $12 million a year. I absolutely hope he\u2019s back but I can see Hightower leaving if his asking price hits anywhere above $14 million per year.\n\nRESULT: Re-signed with Patriots for 4 years, $43.5 million\n \n*Logan Ryan, CB* - Another Patriots player that has progressed each year to become an impactful player, Logan Ryan is an interesting case. Ryan has shown the ability to absolutely shut down both big and shifty receivers alike, defend the run spectacularly, and has [amazing ball skills,](https://gfycat.com/ShrillDigitalFly) however Ryan can sometimes find himself in the middle of a bad game. Although the great most definitely outweighs the bad, Logan Ryan is not the #1 cornerback that many teams will most likely view him as. Best suited as a #2 corner, Ryan will most likely break the bank with a cornerback-needy team like the Bears and find himself with an offer the Patriots won\u2019t be willing to match, much to my dismay. The Patriots\u2019 trade for Eric Rowe along with the drafting of Cyrus Jones is also further proof that Belichick is preparing for life without Ryan, and his contract situation will be an interesting one to watch this offseason.\n\nRESULT: Signed with Titans for 3 years, $30 million\n\n*Martellus Bennett, TE* - I truly believe that without Martellus Bennett we would have not made it to the Super Bowl. Many will look at Bennett\u2019s receiving stats towards the end of the season and note that he was not a big factor in the passing game but that was mainly because Bennett as a pass protector/run blocker is basically like having an extra offensive tackle on the field, seriously, [he\u2019s that good.](https://res.cloudinary.com/cmgverticals/image/upload/f_auto,q_80/v1474247908/MartellusBennettPassProtection_ppkohu.gif) When running routes, Bennett showed consistent hands and a nice bit of [wiggle after the catch.](https://gfycat.com/FarPeriodicIrishwaterspaniel) Bennett made the loss of Gronkowski seem minimal despite dealing with a nagging ankle injury all throughout the season. Bennett has not been shy about expressing both his love for the Patriots and Boston, but he also isn\u2019t afraid to talk about other teams\u2019 tendency to overpay for super bowl champions. If Bennett were willing to take less money to stay Belichick would jump at the opportunity, but a double digit per year contract seems likely and not in the Patriots\u2019 cards.\n\nRESULT: Signed with Packers for 3 years, $21 million\n \n*Jabaal Sheard, DE* - Jabaal Sheard is one of the most polarizing players on the Patriots defense. Sheard was signed from the Browns before the start of the 2015 season after being underutilized in their 3-4 scheme and had a remarkable season. I have no doubt that Sheard\u2019s [emergence in 2015](https://gfycat.com/DamagedBetterAcornbarnacle) led to the making the decision of trading Chandler Jones a lot easier, however Sheard took a large step back in the first half of 2016 season. Sheard\u2019s discipline in contain, something he was [remarkable at in 2015,](https://gfycat.com/DefensiveAgreeableDuck) started lacking and he was responsible for a few large run plays by opposing offenses. The lowest point of his 2016 season came in week 9 when Sheard was benched after a horrible first half against the Seahawks and was then designated as a healthy scratch for week 10 against the 49ers. Belichick\u2019s message to Sheard was clear and he responded in a big way as he [came back playing like the effective player](https://gfycat.com/SpiritedFlakyAmericanbadger) pats fans remembered from 2015. The inconsistent play must be something resting on the Patriots personnel\u2019s mind, but Sheard has shown that he can be an extremely effective player when he turns it on. Whether or not Belichick sees the value of signing Sheard to another contract remains to be seen, however another team will most likely overpay for Sheard and he has most likely played his last snap in New England.\n\nRESULT: Signed with Colts for 3 years, $25.5 million\n \n*Duron Harmon, S* - Harmon is another player I believe to be on his way out, albeit for good reason. Harmon is regarded as one of the smartest players on the Patriots and is also one of the most solid. Outside of a mediocre performance against the Falcons, Harmon has shown that he has the [ability to be an above average Cover 1/Cover 2 free safety in the NFL.](https://gfycat.com/HighRaggedJabiru) Although he was our third safety in 2016, Harmon logged a significant chunk of snaps covering the deep part of the field so Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung could play closer to the line of scrimmage. Harmon gave the Patriots insane flexibility in the secondary and I believe other teams will see his value. The pats could re-sign Harmon as Chung\u2019s replacement, however their roles are very different as Chung is more of a hybrid strong safety/linebacker that plays close to the line of scrimmage the majority of the time. Whether he stays or goes Harmon is inching closer to major success and I\u2019m excited to see the next step of his journey.\n\nRESULT: Re-signed with Patriots for 4 years, $20 million\n \n*Alan Branch, DT* - Alan Branch was incredible in 2016. The 6\u20196\u201d monster routinely absorbed double teams to free up linebackers and was extremely [stout against the run.](https://gfycat.com/KaleidoscopicWhoppingIrishterrier) Branch has experienced a career revitalization, like virtually every player Belichick signs, and will be looking to cash-in this free agency. Although he had a great season, Branch\u2019s age might be a concern for the Patriots or other teams as he\u2019ll be 32 at the start of the 2017 season. Branch showed that he\u2019s in great shape though and I feel that the patriots would not mind signing him to a deal similar to Vince Wilfork\u2019s with the Texans two years ago (2 years, $9 million).\n\nRESULT: Re-signed with Patriots for 2 years, $12 million\n ","score_hidden":null,"archived":null,"name":null,"author":"timnog","author_flair_text":"Patriots","downs":null,"created_utc":"1489765475","subreddit_id":"t5_2qmg3","link_id":"t3_5zy93e","parent_id":"t3_5zy93e","score":"84","retrieved_on":"1491557919","controversiality":"0","gilded":"0","id":"df1zi83","subreddit":"nfl","ups":null,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_css_class":"patriots"}

Obviously no single post-season can be singled out, but I think that winning several SB, and consistently performing in the playoffs, is indicative that you got the job done, which is perhaps the most important thing you want for a qb. \n\nAlso, with regards to the other players, those sports also had a period of their league where there simply was no parity for several reasons (few teams, no salary cap etc.) There were only 8 teams in the league when Bill Russell won 11. Henri Richard won his 11 when there were only 6 teams in the league. No one argues that those guys are the GOAT because the league they played in is not comparable to the league that MJ or Gretzky played in. No one argues that Otto Graham is the GOAT either, despite the fact that he has 7 championships. He just played in such a different era that it's futile to make any comparisons.\n\nAlso Gretzky was just so far ahead of everyone else in terms of productivity.

Does he adjust his defensive philosophy to use guys like williamsn dareus, etc? Nope. He takes 4-3 guys and tries to make them work in an overly complicated 3-4...because that's his \"thing.\" \n\nGo look at the patriots defensive roster from like 2001-2009, then from like 2010 onward. As belichick lost 3-4 guys like ty warren, vince wilfork, and richard seymour, and tried to replace them with guys like kyle love, and ron brace (unsuccessfully) he began to transition toward 4-3 guys. He starts drafting guys like chander jones, dominic easley, malcolm brown.

He went 11-5 in 2010. It's not like he ever went 13-3 or 14-2. \n\nYes, if you give him ed reed, ray lewis, and tarrel suggs (in their primes) hecan come up with a great defense.

He was throwing his passes *way* too hard and low for awhile because he just had so little trust in his receiving corps).\n\nBut there was definitely a lot of reason to think that *part* of the problem was a Brady decline. The Pats were lining things up to make it easier to move on from Brady in the near future (a course they later reversed), and when the Pats stomped the Bengals the game after Kansas City, [Gronk said:](http://www.patriots.com/video/2014/10/05/press-pass-rob-gronkowski) \n\n&gt;*\"I told my brother before we came to the game... 'I'm gonna make 12 look like Tom Brady again, baby.' And I went out there, with my teammates, and we made Tom Brady look like Tom Brady* after you guys were criticizing him all week. The fans, everything. And it feels so good, and he's such a leader, and he went over 50,000 yards today, he's an unbelievable player and I'm so glad to play with him.\n\nWatching the video there's definitely a bit of an impression that Gronk viewed Brady as a lion in winter (albeit later in the interview he called Brady a \"young buck\" and said \"he's got a lot in his tank left.\"). There's an implication that making Brady look like Brady was an accomplishment by the receiving corps and the OL, rather than a function of them snapping out of a funk and *letting* Brady look like Brady again.\n\nAll of which is to say, while the media *definitely* overreacted after the KC loss and was ignoring huge and obvious extenuating factors, there was some reason to wonder. I think [this Summer 2014 article](http://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/story/_/id/11020311/tom-brady-no-longer-top-5-qb-nfl) by one of PFF's more notable writers arguing that Brady was no longer a top 5 QB was flat out wrong even at the time, but you can understand why the discussion was going on, and it certainly looked, at the surface level, like Brady would at least *soon* no longer be a top 5 QB.\n","score":"18","subreddit":"nfl"}

Throughout that contract they played in 2 AFCCG, 1 Super Bowl, and he missed 1 season.\n\nIn 2010, he signed a contract that made him **the** highest paid player in the league. On *that* contract they played in 2 AFCCGs and 1 Super Bowl.\n\nIn 2012 he effectively took a \"paycut\" in terms of cap hit, but didn't lose money. [Seriously](http://patscap.com/brady.html), with his \"discount\" from 2012 on, he averaged $16.4m in *cash* that he received every single year. Are we saying that that's a discount? His cap hit is, but that's financial \"wizardry\" not being cheap. He's getting in cash around what most QBs are getting - Ryan will get around $17-18m in *cash* this year, but his contract means he has an additional $5m in signing bonus - he got that when he signed the contract.\n\n\nThis whole \"Brady is a team player thing\" is absurd - they went undefeated when he was one of the highest paid players. They had the 2010 amazing season when he was the highest paid player. They played in 2 Super Bowls after his big contracts.\n\nBut nope, his contract is the MVP.\n\n\nEDIT: To add on to this, his contract he signed meant that if he got cut in 2016, he'd have $26m in dead money. If he gets cut next year, it's still $13m. That means that if he sucked they are hurting bad with money.

Add to this stories of him banging his head against a wall in the locker room after the playoff loss. \n\n2. It's the New York Giants. They get a lot of spotlight by virtue of being a New York team. The Jets may have been a dumpster fire of epic proportions this season but since they've been eliminated, all the attention's on the Giants. This was also the best playoff game of Wildcard Weekend, scheduled in the best slot. \n\n3. Odell and the receivers played horribly in Green Bay. This after the boat picture and warming up without any shirts. When you ask for that much attention from the world, you've got to perform. \n\nThis whole thing is fucking stupid. I personally don't think going to Miami was a big deal. A giants fan on this forum also wrote that Odell's been flying out after games all season to go to LA. I can't verify whether that's true or not, but if it is it's clear that Odell and co. just had a bad game. \n\nGoing forward Odell just needs to be more low key with his partying.

The Pats were lining things up to make it easier to move on from Brady in the near future (a course they later reversed), and when the Pats stomped the Bengals the game after Kansas City, [Gronk said:](http://www.patriots.com/video/2014/10/05/press-pass-rob-gronkowski) \n\n&gt;*\"I told my brother before we came to the game... 'I'm gonna make 12 look like Tom Brady again, baby.' And I went out there, with my teammates, and we made Tom Brady look like Tom Brady* after you guys were criticizing him all week. The fans, everything. And it feels so good, and he's such a leader, and he went over 50,000 yards today, he's an unbelievable player and I'm so glad to play with him.\n\nWatching the video there's definitely a bit of an impression that Gronk viewed Brady as a lion in winter (albeit later in the interview he called Brady a \"young buck\" and said \"he's got a lot in his tank left.\"). There's an implication that making Brady look like Brady was an accomplishment by the receiving corps and the OL, rather than a function of them snapping out of a funk and *letting* Brady look like Brady again.\n\nAll of which is to say, while the media *definitely* overreacted after the KC loss and was ignoring huge and obvious extenuating factors, there was some reason to wonder. I think [this Summer 2014 article](http://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/story/_/id/11020311/tom-brady-no-longer-top-5-qb-nfl) by one of PFF's more notable writers arguing that Brady was no longer a top 5 QB was flat out wrong even at the time, but you can understand why the discussion was going on, and it certainly looked, at the surface level, like Brady would at least *soon* no longer be a top 5 QB.\n","score":"18","subreddit":"nfl"}

What grown man, let alone one with disposable income goes to bed as early as Brady? His sole focus is to continue to play as long as he possibly can, its quite remarkable. \n\nEdit: Found the article [here](http://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20160115/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-diet#1)","score":"13","subreddit":"nfl"}

Obviously no single post-season can be singled out, but I think that winning several SB, and consistently performing in the playoffs, is indicative that you got the job done, which is perhaps the most important thing you want for a qb. \n\nAlso, with regards to the other players, those sports also had a period of their league where there simply was no parity for several reasons (few teams, no salary cap etc.) There were only 8 teams in the league when Bill Russell won 11. Henri Richard won his 11 when there were only 6 teams in the league. No one argues that those guys are the GOAT because the league they played in is not comparable to the league that MJ or Gretzky played in. No one argues that Otto Graham is the GOAT either, despite the fact that he has 7 championships. He just played in such a different era that it's futile to make any comparisons.\n\nAlso Gretzky was just so far ahead of everyone else in terms of productivity.

It specializes in physical therapy and treating athletes of all kinds, **including active Patriots players**, and developing fitness and wellness routines for them.\n\nIn fact, TB12 is paid, **by the Patriots**, to provide treatment and nutritional supplements for the team and its players.  Because this is a private business deal, the amount the Patriots are paying TB12 is undisclosed and unknown.

I mean, it makes sense in that Brady has been trying to grow his brand for over a decade and may have now in fact found it in his high performance late in age which TB12's services now align perfect with, but still, this arrangement is remarkable.

[Seriously](http://patscap.com/brady.html), with his \"discount\" from 2012 on, he averaged $16.4m in *cash* that he received every single year. Are we saying that that's a discount? His cap hit is, but that's financial \"wizardry\" not being cheap. He's getting in cash around what most QBs are getting - Ryan will get around $17-18m in *cash* this year, but his contract means he has an additional $5m in signing bonus - he got that when he signed the contract.\n\n\nThis whole \"Brady is a team player thing\" is absurd - they went undefeated when he was one of the highest paid players.

Odell's been a vortex of drama this season and the media's got a lot of views by promoting him. fighting the kicking net, tantrums on the sideline, proposing to the kicking net, and now this boat business. Add to this stories of him banging his head against a wall in the locker room after the playoff loss. \n\n2. It's the New York Giants. They get a lot of spotlight by virtue of being a New York team. The Jets may have been a dumpster fire of epic proportions this season but since they've been eliminated, all the attention's on the Giants. This was also the best playoff game of Wildcard Weekend, scheduled in the best slot. \n\n3. Odell and the receivers played horribly in Green Bay. This after the boat picture and warming up without any shirts. When you ask for that much attention from the world, you've got to perform. \n\nThis whole thing is fucking stupid. I personally don't think going to Miami was a big deal. A giants fan on this forum also wrote that Odell's been flying out after games all season to go to LA. I can't verify whether that's true or not, but if it is it's clear that Odell and co. just had a bad game. \n\nGoing forward Odell just needs to be more low key with his partying. Dude's a major celebrity and he's only 24. Everyone wants to hang out with this guy and party with him. There's no doubt he wants to stunt on the world a bit, hence the post on social media. But the scrutiny isn't worth it. He's an emotional guy and to have to hear about the boat over and over again after the loss must have driven him crazy. Especially since he lead the offence into the post-season in the first place. People should remember what a force he was this season, instead everyone's gonna remember him flopping against the Packers.  \n\n\n\n","score":"679","subreddit":"nfl"}

Does he adjust his defensive philosophy to use guys like williamsn dareus, etc? Nope. He takes 4-3 guys and tries to make them work in an overly complicated 3-4...because that's his \"thing.\" \n\nGo look at the patriots defensive roster from like 2001-2009, then from like 2010 onward. As belichick lost 3-4 guys like ty warren, vince wilfork, and richard seymour, and tried to replace them with guys like kyle love, and ron brace (unsuccessfully) he began to transition toward 4-3 guys. He starts drafting guys like chander jones, dominic easley, malcolm brown.

He went 11-5 in 2010. It's not like he ever went 13-3 or 14-2. \n\nYes, if you give him ed reed, ray lewis, and tarrel suggs (in their primes) hecan come up with a great defense.

Teams used to basically hold the rights of players forever.

{"body":"I'm biased and haven't watched Jordan, but Brady has now led 5 game winning drives in SB. He has 51 in his career, and I believe he is the only one above .500 when given chance to win. It's hard to top that.\n\n[Tied or trailing by eight points or fewer in the fourth quarter or overtime? Brady is your man. His 50-43 record and .538 winning percentage in these situations leads the league since 2001, among players with at least 50 total games played.
